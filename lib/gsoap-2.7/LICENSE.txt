gSOAP is distributed under a choice of:

* The gSOAP Public License 1.3 (which is based on the Mozilla public license
  1.1). Components not covered by the gSOAP Public License are wsdl2h and its
  source code output, UDDI, and several sample applications, see note below.

* OR GPL (GNU Public License, a common open-source software license).

* OR a proprietary software development site license.

Pick the license that applies best for your intended use. The software is
offered under GPL conditions to enable the software to be used with open source
GPL projects, educational use, and so on. We do not accept third-party GPL
contributions to avoid having to fork the code base in GPL and non-GPL.

Parts of this program are released under the GPL with the additional exemption
that compiling, linking, and/or using OpenSSL is allowed.

IMPORTANT NOTE: the wsdl2h parser, UDDI code, and sample applications such as
the stand-alone web server are distributed ONLY under the GPL or the
proprietary license. This means that commercial use of wsdl2h to generate code
for product development, or the use of the UDDI source code, or the use of code
from the sample Web service applications requires the proprietary software
development license. The reason for this is that the wsdl2h tool, UDDI and some
of the sample applications are not developed at Florida State University.
Please contact me by email if you have any questions on licensing and software
support: engelen@genivia.com

The parts of the code that are distributed under the GPL or Genivia's
commercial license are:

* The wsdl2h WSDL parser source code and the code generated by it.

* The UDDI source code.

* The examples included in the gSOAP distribution package 'samples' directory.
